# bicycle_users_prediction
Predicting the number of bicycle users in particular hour of the day, given the weather conditions, date, and time.

We have hourly data for 2011-2012. Dataset is relatively small, clean and already
clipped/normalized.
● Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering/selection are conducted
● Dropped some unnecessary variables and values and encoded the categorical variables.
● Four models are built in which XGBoost and Deep Learning show the best results.
● We can improve the results by acquiring more data, creating more feature, and ensembling/stacking.
